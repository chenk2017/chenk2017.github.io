We conducted 3D hydrodynamic simulations to study velocity perturbations during planet-disk interactions, followed by radiative transfer post-processing to examine kinematic signatures in synthetic images. For the first time, We propose using residual velocity and channel maps—created by subtracting an azimuthally averaged background—to reveal planet-induced velocity perturbations. We also fully assessed the impact of two key simulation parameters, simulation duration and resolution. We find that stable kinematic patterns require longer runs (1,000 planetary orbits) and that velocities in spiral regions require high resolution (at least 14 cells per disk scale height) to meet convergence criteria. These findings provide guidance for selecting parameters in kinematic simulations of planet-disk interactions and help quantify planet-driven kinematic features to identify protoplanets in disks in the ALMA era.
