My name is Kan Chen (陈侃). I am a fourth-year PhD student at University College London (UCL), supervised by [Dr. Mihkel Kama](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/astrophysics/people/mihkel-kama) (UCL) and [Dr. Paola Pinilla](https://paola-pinilla.com) (UCL/MSSL). My research focuses on protoplanetary disks and planet-disk interactions, with the ultimate goal of better understanding how (exo)planets form and exploring whether our Earth and solar system are unique in the universe. I use numerical simulations to study how planets interact with their natal protoplanetary disks and link the simulation results to observations. I am also interested in common physical processes across different scales of structure in the universe.
