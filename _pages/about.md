My name is Kan Chen (陈侃). I am a KIAA Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics (KIAA), Peking University. My host is [Prof. Ruobing Dong](https://www.ruobingdong.com/). Previously, I obtained my PhD in Astrophysics at University College London (UCL) in 2025, supervised by [Prof. Mihkel Kama](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/78326-mihkel-kama) (UCL) and [Prof. Paola Pinilla](https://paola-pinilla.com) (UCL/MSSL). My research focuses on protoplanetary disks and planet–disk interactions, with the ultimate goal of better understanding how (exo)planets form and exploring whether Earth and the solar system are unique in the universe. I use numerical simulations to study how planets interact with their natal protoplanetary disks and connect the simulation results to observations. I am also interested in common physical processes across different scales of structure in the universe.
